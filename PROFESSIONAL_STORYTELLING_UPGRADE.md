**Example:** "Following the butterfly, Batu discovered a hidden door behind the old oak tree..."

### 3. Encounter (Karşılaşma)
**Purpose:** Meet a friendly guide or magical object
**Example:** "Inside, a wise owl greeted him with a warm hoot and offered him a glowing compass..."

### 4. Obstacle (Engel)
**Purpose:** A small, fun problem to solve
**Example:** "The path ahead was blocked by a river of stars. How could he cross?"

### 5. Climax (Zirve)
**Purpose:** Hero uses courage or intelligence
**Example:** "Batu remembered the compass! He held it high and the stars formed a bridge..."

### 6. Lesson/Return (Ders/Dönüş)
**Purpose:** Warm feeling learned from adventure
**Example:** "The owl smiled. 'You were brave and clever. That's the real magic.'"

### 7. Happy Ending (Mutlu Son)
